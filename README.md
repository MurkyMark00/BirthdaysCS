# BirthdaysCS
C# Console Project that takes birthdays from a .csv file and returns information about their date.

You need to a have a .csv file in the same directory. File format should be like this:
	
	day1/month1,name1
	day2/month2,name2
	day3/month3,name3
	...
	
After running Program.cs, you should get a sorted output of birthdays with the closest one at the bottom.
